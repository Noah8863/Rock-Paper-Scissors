# Rock, Paper, Scissors Console Game

Welcome to the Rock, Paper, Scissors console game! This project is a simple implementation of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game in C#.

## How to Play

1. Open the project in your preferred C# development environment.

2. Run the program.

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to input your choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors).

4. See the result of the game as the computer makes its choice.

## Learning Goals

I created this Rock, Paper, Scissors console game as a hands-on project to dive into the fundamentals of C# and gain a better understanding of how the language works. As someone more familiar with languages like JavaScript, this project serves as a practical exploration to compare and contrast the core concepts.

Through this project, I aimed to grasp the following fundamental concepts in C#:

- Console input and output.
- Conditional statements (if, else if, else).
- Switch statements.
- Random number generation.
